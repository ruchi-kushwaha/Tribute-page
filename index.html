            <li>Anubhav Singh Bassi is one of the best-selling stand-up comedian and an Indian YouTube sensation. He is famous among the youth for his nostalgic content.</li>
            <li>Anubhav is a story-teller. Retrospective comedy is his USP. Most of his sets are nostalgic, based on his past experiences with his friends at school and college.</li>
            <li>Anubhav was an all-rounder student.&nbsp;In a TEDx Talks video, he mentioned that he actively participated in all the extra-curricular activities, like debate, extempore, singing, dancing, theatre, etc., as well as sports in his school days. He revealed that he wanted to explore every field.</li>
            <li>In 2008, during his school days,&nbsp;Anubhav was badged as the head boy at Dewan Public School&nbsp; (Meerut).
      </li>
            <li>Anubhav tried a lot of career options; starting off as a lawyer. Later, he turned into a UPSC aspirant; however, he couldn’t taste success in UPSC examination. Thereafter, he tried running a fast-food restaurant, pursued a job in a law firm, but miserably failed at both too. Finally, in 2017, he pursued a career in stand-up comedy and is still standing strong there.</li>
            <li>
              He has also worked with a start-up. In his spare time, he started going to open mics. One day, he googled about an open mic and landed there. When asked by the host whether he had a script, he murmured,
        <blockquote><p><strong>"Apni bezzati toh kar hi lenge”</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>Though the first upload on his YouTube channel was a stand-up video titled ‘Cheating,’ but actually his first video was a set based on lawyers, which he uploaded on his Facebook account.</li>
            <li>It was his YouTube debut in 2019 titled ‘Cheating’, which made him a star overnight. The video received more than 39 million views.</li>
            <li>Unlike other stand-up comedians, Anubhav doesn’t upload many videos on his YouTube channel. His&nbsp;YouTube channel has three stand-up videos only (as in 2020). When asked in an interview, “Why don’t you post much content on your channel,” he replied,
           <blockquote><p><strong>"I am a live performer. For me, to develop content, I need a live audience. Without that, we would never know if the line or the joke is actually funny or not.”</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
             </li>
            <li>
              He has received&nbsp;YouTube Golden Button for crossing 10,00,000 subscribers and has&nbsp;1.88 million subscribers (as in 2020).
